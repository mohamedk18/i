Types architecture pattern and Systems?

There are several types of software architecture patterns that are commonly used to organize the components in software architecture.
 Some of the most important and commonly used patterns include:

-1) Layered Pattern: This pattern separates components into layers of subtasks, arranged one above another.
  Each layer has unique tasks to do and all the layers are independent of one another.
  Since each layer is independent, one can modify the code inside a layer without affecting others.

-2) Client-Server Pattern: This pattern has two major entities: a server and multiple clients. The server has resources (data, files or services) and a client requests server
  for a particular resource.
  Then the server processes the request and responds back accordingly.

-3) Event-Driven Pattern: In this pattern, services (operations) of the software are triggered by events.

-4) Microkernel Pattern: This pattern is based on a small operating system kernel that provides only basic services, while other services are built on top of it in user space.

-5) Microservices Pattern: This pattern structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, which implement business capabilities.

Each pattern organizes the components differently for solving a specific problem in software architectures. The best choice depends on the specific needs of your project and
