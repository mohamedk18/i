what is fragmentation in operating system...?


Fragmentation is an issue that can occur in operating systems where processes are loaded and unloaded from memory, causing free space to become fragmented.

This can result in a situation where a process cannot be allocated to a memory block due to its small size, leaving the memory blocks unused.

There are two main types of fragmentation: internal and external fragmentation. Internal fragmentation occurs when there is unused space within a memory block.

For example, if a system allocates a 64KB block of memory to store a file that is only 40KB in size, that block will contain 24KB of internal fragmentation.

This can occur when the system employs a fixed-size block allocation method.

External fragmentation occurs when a storage medium, such as a hard disk or solid-state drive, has many small blocks of free space scattered throughout it.

This can happen when a system frequently creates and deletes files, leaving many small blocks of free space on the medium. When the system needs to store a new file, it may be unable to find a single contiguous block of free space large enough to store the file and must instead store the file in multiple smaller blocks.

This can cause external fragmentation and performance problems when accessing the file.

Fragmentation can significantly impact the performance of an operating system by slowing down the read and write speed of the disk. 

As the disk head has to move to different locations to access the fragments of a file, the access time increases, reducing the overall speed of the system.
